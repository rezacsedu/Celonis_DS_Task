## Gesture detection from time-series data using DeepLearning4j library
From a given time-series data, the task is to lassify it into one of the 8 classes. I developed the solution in DeepLearning4j, just to show that depending upon the requirements, I can work in Java too. The Java version is pushed in the java branch. Using the logistic regression, following results were achieved:

``` Precision: 0.85
    Recall: 0.88125
    Accuracy: 0.8461538461538461
```
This is a Maven project, by the way. I can give a live demo too, if you'd be interested in.
